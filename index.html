The unintended consequences of pesticides is one of the main drivers of the negative<br >impact of modern industrial agriculture on the environment. Pesticides, because they are toxic chemicals meant to kill pest species, can affect non-target species, <br>such as plants, animals and humans. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, because they are sprayed or spread across entire agricultural fields.[1] Other agrochemicals, such as fertilizers, can also have negative effects on the environment.</p>

               <p style="font-size:20px ;">In this paragraph, we will focus on the harmful effects of deforestation. The effects of deforestation can be jotted down. The first effect of deforestation is the degradation of soil quality.<br> Degradation of soil quality is triggered by the removal of the topsoil layer. The trees hold on to the topsoil with their roots. The roots are used to derive nutrients from the soil.<br> When deforestation occurs, the trees are either cut down or uprooted. The former leads to soil loosening and the <br>later causes the roots to decay. Decaying roots increase the number of alkaline salts in the soil, making them unfit for agriculture.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px ;">Water is the most important natural resource. It is a necessary component of all life on earth, whether human life, plants, animals, or any living being. No living organism can ever survive without water. Water is also required for agricultural and industrial activities, other than for routine tasks. Today, we are unaware of the dangers posed by water wastage. We make only a feeble attempt to conserve water. Water is wasted in social gatherings, programmes, and celebrations. Every day, we waste water in our homes as well. We have this habit of leaving the tap open while brushing, washing, bathing, etc. So, significant actions must be taken to conserve water.</p>
